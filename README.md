# Paratransit Fleet Scheduler
Goal: A paratransit ridesharing service to augment existing public transit resources. Patron requests will be serviced through a variable fleet of vehicles. Patrons will be able to request a ride for a specific address and time via our website, and drivers will receive generated schedules at the beginning of their shift through our website interface. These routes will be optimized for efficient travel time, while maximizing patrons served.
